       What is so special with ninjaBot ?
       
         1. It patches tcpip.sys at winxp machines to be able to handle 8000 connections.
         2. It has persistance
         3. It add itself to win xp firewall.
         4. If it finds itself behind a firewall, it will use a other bots ftp (by communicating with it) to spread.
         5. If a bot with greater version joins channel, it will ask for update.
         6. It has a built in honeypot that catches spreading malware. At the moment supporting for only Beagle, mydoom and VNC.
         7. It will look so the ftp it has works before using it to spread (every time it finds a vurln computer). It does not work it requests a new working one.
       
       
       Note:
         This bots uses some outdated but might-still-work exploits such as:
           NetAPI, UPNP (2 kinds), Netbios (2 kinds), LSASS2 and VNC
         
         This bot has protection againt excess flood so it cannot be flooded out.
         
         These commands can be written at end of mostly
         commands. Some example are below.
               
       Commands:
         +priv or +p    - Makes the result/output be private
         +silent or +s  - Makes the bot not return any info
         
         +portscan      - Can ONLY be used by .scan command.
                          Makes bot only PORTSCAN and no exploit.
         +show          - Can ONLY be used by .scan command.
                          This turns "showtries" command ON.
         +update        - Can ONLY be used by .download command.
                          This forces a update on bot.
